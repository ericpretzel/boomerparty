#boomerparty
This is a turn-based word game basically replicating 
[BombParty](http://bombparty.sparklinlabs.com/), written by me using
 Java 8. This also uses only data structures written by me because 
 this is for a school project. Constructive criticism is highly welcome!

You can run the game by downloading [Server.jar](jar/Server.jar) to 
host a game and connect to a server with [Client.jar](jar/Client.jar). 
Currently, I think the game only works on a local network.
